To run,

    ../runlinear grep

    ../runconcrete grep

At this point, the concrete trace will tell us that the last pointer (inflate_dynamic__6__mem_222) we tried to dereference was pointing to the memory address that is way more off from the start position (0xbffff6). Open the trace (grep_dir/grep.postconcrete.c) and add the following assertion at the end of the trace.

    assert(dfaexec__5__p < 0xc10000);

Next,

    ../runexplain grep
