To run,

    runlinear sed

    runconcrete sed

At this point, the concrete trace will tell us that the last pointer (re_search_2__6__mem_1406) we tried to dereference was pointing to the non-sensical memory address 0x2a8. Open the trace (sed_dir/sed.postconcrete.c) and add the following assertion at the end of the trace.

    assert(re_search_2__6__mem_1406 > 1024);

Next,

    runexplain sed
