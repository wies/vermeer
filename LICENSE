The VERMEER benchmarks include code and test data from the
Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository, excluded from the above
copyright and license. It's license:

SIR User License
Preamble:

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature,
intent, and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a
part of this License. The legal effect of this License is dependent
only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.

This license is based upon the principle that the sharing of
scientific resources with other research and teaching institutions is
vital to higher education and the development of knowledge and
understanding. Further, the sharing of materials, including source
code where applicable, is mutually beneficial. However, these must be
weighed against the protection of intellectual property. Therefore, we
allow the free use of our repository resource, and the materials and
software therein, at other institutions of research and higher
learning, but reserve the rights to provide access to the repository
and sell, modify, and distribute the materials and software
therein. We further allow the use of materials and software source
code in order to improve the application but restrict the use of these
materials and source code.  License:

NOTICE - READ ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT
PRIOR TO ACCESSING THE REPOSITORY AND BEFORE DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING
AND/OR USING AND OF THE MATERIALS THEREIN. BOTH ACCESSING THE
REPOSITORY, AND DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING AND/OR USING THE MATERIALS
COVERED BY THIS LICENSE INDICATES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

    GRANT OF RIGHT: The Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository
    (the "Resource"), all software, including binary and source code,
    and artifacts therein (the "Materials"), and any related
    documentation (the "Documentation") are licensed, not sold, to
    you. The University of Nebraska grants you a personal,
    non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use the Resource,
    Materials, and Documentation, subject to the terms and
    restrictions of this Agreement. The Resource, Materials, and
    Documentation may be used by you, or an organization of which you
    are a member or employee, solely for non-commercial, educational,
    evaluation and/or personal use. "Non-commercial use" means uses
    that are not or will not result in (a) the sale, lease or rental
    of Materials or Documentation, or access to the Resource; and/or
    (b) the use of the Materials or Documentation in any commercial
    product or service.

    You may make as many copies of the Materials and/or Documentation
    as needed in order to use and/or modify the software and/or
    artifacts. However, you may not redistribute the Materials with
    your changes without approval of the ESQuaReD Laboratory, the
    Computer Science and Engineering Department, and the University of
    Nebraska. You may donate your changes to the Repository
    (Resource), in which case we may opt to include your changes in
    the official presentation of the Resource or distribution of the
    Materials.

    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE NOT TO
    USE, COPY, MODIFY OR TRANSFER THE Materials OR Documentation OR
    ANY COPY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART. You agree to use your best efforts
    to prevent and protect the contents of the Resource, Materials,
    and Documentation from unauthorized disclosure or use. You agree
    not to sublicense, assign, delegate, rent, lease or otherwise
    transfer this license or any of the related rights or obligations
    for any reason. Any modifications to the Materials and/or
    Documentation, or software or artifacts derived from the Materials
    and/or Documentation provided by the Resource ("Derivative Works")
    are governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
    University of Nebraska reserves all rights not expressly granted
    to you. NO OTHER LICENSES ARE GRANTED OR IMPLIED.

    OWNERSHIP: The Resource, Materials, and Documentation are and will
    remain the sole property of the University of Nebraska. The
    Resource, Materials, and Documentation are copyrighted works and
    protected by copyright law and/or contain proprietary information
    protected at law. The University of Nebraska may at any time
    assign or transfer all or part of its interests in any rights to
    the Resource, Materials, or Documentation.

    EXCLUSIONS: Some of the software available from the Resource may
    be governed by existing copyrights and/or legal terms and
    conditions of use and distribution. The University of Nebraska's
    right of ownership does not extend to include such software to the
    extent that such a claim conflicts with the terms of the existing
    licenses. However, the University of Nebraska does NOT relinquish
    any right to ownership to any and all artifacts associated with
    the software, that were not originally distributed with the
    software and are not governed by existing licenses. This includes,
    but is not limited to, any testing and experimentation artifacts
    provided with the software, and any changes to source code that
    are incidental to the functionality (do not extend or improve the
    functionality) of the software, and thus are not governed under
    existing licenses. The University of Nebraska reserves all rights
    to these Materials as governed by the terms of this Agreement.

    DISPUTES: The University of Nebraska is committed to respecting
    all intellectual property claims and rights as governed by law. If
    you feel that the inclusion of any Materials provided by the
    Resource infringe upon your rights, you agree to provide written
    notice of your claim to the ESQuaRed Laboratory, the Computer
    Science and Engineering Department, and the University of
    Nebraska, for remedy. In the event that you are not satisfied with
    the remedy provided to you, any dispute between you and the
    University of Nebraska shall be submitted to final and binding
    arbitration as the sole and exclusive remedy for such controversy
    or dispute. Any claim required to be submitted to arbitration
    shall be made by filing a demand for arbitration within one (1)
    year following the occurrence first giving rise to the claim. The
    right and duty of the parties to resolve disputes by arbitration
    shall be governed exclusively by the United States Federal
    Arbitration Act. The arbitration will be held in Lincoln,
    Nebraska. Each party shall bear all of its own costs of
    arbitration, except that the fees of the arbitrator shall be
    divided equally between the parties. The arbitrator shall have no
    authority to amend or modify the terms of this Agreement or to
    award punitive or exemplary damages, and the award may be enforced
    by judgment in a United States Court of Law.

    LIMITATIONS ON USE: You agree not to transfer, sell, rent, lease,
    publish or otherwise distribute copies of the Resource, Materials,
    and/or Documentation to others including individuals internal or
    external to your own organization.

    FEEDBACK: In consideration for this license, if you provide any
    feedback, reports on bugs, or errors in the Resource, Materials,
    or Documentation, or suggested modifications (collectively
    "Feedback") during the term of this Agreement, we shall have the
    right to use such Feedback for any purpose without payment or
    accounting to you.

    CONTRIBUTIONS: In consideration for this license, if you provide
    any modifications or additions to artifacts, software, or
    documentation, or any other content governed by this license
    (collectively "Contribution(s)") during the term of this
    Agreement, we shall have the right to add such Contribution(s) to
    the Resource without payment or accounting to you. Furthermore,
    the act of providing any such Contribution(s) transfers all rights
    of ownership to the University of Nebraska as governed under the
    terms of this Agreement, except where expressly excluded by the
    terms of this Agreement. By submitting the Contribution(s) to the
    Resource, you relinquish any existing claims to copyright or
    ownership (your "Rights") insofar as you are granted legal claim
    to those Rights. In the event that we believe that you are not
    legally entitled to transfer your Rights to the Contribution(s),
    we will decline to accept the Contribution(s) and no transfer of
    ownership or Rights shall be considered to have occurred. We also
    reserve the right to decline to accept any Contribution(s) for any
    reason, or without reason at all, in which case no transfer of
    ownership shall be considered to have occurred, and you shall
    retain all Rights previously granted to you.

    EXCLUSIONS: Any Contribution(s) governed by an existing license
    permitting free copy and redistribution of the Contribution(s)
    shall be exempt from the transfer of Rights condition.

    TERMINATION: This license is effective until terminated. You may
    terminate this license at any time by requesting, in writing,
    discontinuation of your access to the Resource, and destroying any
    Materials and/or Documentation, including any permitted archival
    copies, you have obtained from the Resource. This license
    automatically terminates if you fail to comply with its terms and
    conditions. The University of Nebraska may terminate this license
    at any time by providing you notice of such termination. Upon
    termination in any manner, you acknowledge that your access to the
    Resource will be discontinued, and agree to destroy all copies of
    any Materials and/or Documentation, obtained from the Resource, in
    your possession. Your obligations under Sections 3 and 9 herein
    shall survive and continue after any termination of this
    Agreement.

    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES: The ESQuaReD
    Laboratory, the Computer Science and Engineering Department, and
    the University of Nebraska have no obligation to support the
    Resource, Materials, or Documentation covered under this
    license. To the extent permitted under applicable law, THE
    Resource, Materials, and Documentation are licensed "AS IS", WITH
    NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
    FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF
    ANY PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY. The ESQuaReD Laboratory,
    the Computer Science and Engineering Department, and the
    University of Nebraska WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL,
    INCIDENTAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER RELIEF, OR FOR ANY
    CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE Resource,
    Materials, or Documentation. Some States and other jurisdictions
    do not allow for the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties
    so the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you. This
    warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have
    other rights which vary from State to State.

    ENTIRE AGREEMENT: This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement
    and understanding between the parties pertaining to the subject
    matter hereof and merges all prior written or oral discussions
    between them. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
    and governed by the laws of the State of Nebraska, United States
    of America, excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts
    for the International Sale of Goods.

    COMMERCIAL LICENSE: For information regarding a commercial license
    please contact the ESQuaReD Laboratory at: Computer Science and
    Engineering Dept., 256 Avery Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588-0115. You may
