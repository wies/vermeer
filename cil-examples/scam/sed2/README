This is one of the 'sed1' examples taken from BugRedex. (input000001 using file000001 and pattern000001).

    make

will do some simple instrumentation on the original code (e.g., breaking down while-statements into multiple lines), generating sed.tendered.c, and then compile the instrumented code.

    make gdbtrace

will run gdb to run the manipulated program to output an execution trace against the example input that will lead it to a crash. The entire gdb output will be saved in 'out_trace_input000001.txt'.

You should use gdb 7.7 or newer.
