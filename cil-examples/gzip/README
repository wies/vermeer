To run,

    ../runlinear allfile

    ../runconcrete allfile

At this point, the concrete trace will tell us that the last pointer (inflate_dynamic__6__mem_222) we tried to dereference was pointing to the non-sensical memory address 0x1. Open the trace (allfile_dir/allfile.postconcrete.c) and add the following assertion at the end of the trace.

    assert(inflate_dynamic__6__mem_222 > 1024);

Next,

    ../runexplain allfile
