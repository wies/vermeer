normal_sen_matrix.? - FEP matrixes, '?' indicates different FEP 
                      evaluation methods.

sth - statement coverage information for every test in test universe.
thcovt - converted sth.

Note: sth and thcovt contain same information, they are only different
on the format:
sth record the infor based on each node, it tells for each node, 
which test have covered it and which are not.
thcovt records info based on each test, it tells for each test,
which node it can cover and which it can not.
