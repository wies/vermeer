8 Statically unreachable edges in the base version.

Edges 21 and 23 in main can't be reached; they'd require
   a programmer error in calling put_end with an illegal prio;
   but all are detected previously

Edges 32 and 34 in main can't be reached; they require get_command
   to return status < 0 but it only returns status 0 or 1

Edges 6 and 8 in new_job require a Malloc error to be reached,
    so we don't reach them

Edges 4 and 6 in get_process require a programmer error in
   calling the proc with an illegal prio; but checks are made
   for such prios before any calls to this proc.
